  <h3>Sugar-Sweetened BeverageTax</h3>
  
    
    <p><a href="/odca-jekyll/referendum/oakland/2016-11-08-hh/">HH Sugar-Sweetened BeverageTax</a></p>
    <p>This measure would impose a tax on the distribution of Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Products in Oakland. Sugar-Sweetened beverages are defined as any beverage to which one or more Caloric Sweeteners have been added and that contain 25 or more calories per 12 fluid ounces of beverage. The tax would not be imposed on infant or baby formula, beverages for medical use, supplemental, meal replacement, or nutritional beverages, milk products, fruit or vegetable juices with no added sweeteners, or alcoholic beverages. The measure would require that any distributor of sugar-sweetened beverages register with the City and establish a Community Advisory Board. The Board would be responsible for making recommendations to the City Council on setting up or funding programs that prevent or reduce the health consequences of consuming sugar-sweetened beverages.</p>
  

  <h3>Lease Term for City-Owned or City-Controlled Property</h3>
  
    
    <p><a href="/odca-jekyll/referendum/oakland/2016-11-08-ii/">II Lease Term for City-Owned or City-Controlled Property</a></p>
    <p>This measure would amend the Charter to increase the term the City Council can lease City-owned or City-controlled real property to a maximum of ninety-nine (99) years. The Oakland City Charter currently authorizes the City Council to lease real property owned or controlled by the City of Oakland for a maximum term of sixty-six (66) years. (City Charter Section 1001).</p>
  

  <h3>Just Cause for Eviction and Rent Adjustment</h3>
  
    
    <p><a href="/odca-jekyll/referendum/oakland/2016-11-08-jj/">JJ Just Cause for Eviction and Rent Adjustment</a></p>
    <p>This measure would: (1) extend the just cause eviction requirements to rental units constructed and approved for occupancy before December 31, 1995, if the units were newly constructed from the group and not created by rehabilitating, improving, or converting pre-existing commercial space or other residential rental space; (2) amend the Rent Ordinance to require that landlords obtain approval from the Rent Program before imposing any rent increases exceeding the Consumer Price Index. Without advance approval, landlords could not make tenants pay any rent increases noticed on or after February 1, 2017 exceeding the allowable adjustment. In addition the measure would require the City to provide an annual notice to residents that would include the amount of the allowable cost-of-living rent adjustment for the year while explaining how to get information for a rent increase.</p>
  

  <h3>Infrastructure and Housing bonds</h3>
  
    
    <p><a href="/odca-jekyll/referendum/oakland/2016-11-08-kk/">KK Infrastructure and Housing bonds</a></p>
    <p>This measure would allow the City to borrow up to $600 million by issuing general obligation bonds. The bonds would be repaid with revenue from an “ad valorem” property tax. “Ad valorem” means according to the value of the property. The City would impose a tax based on the value of real property and improvements within the City to pay the principal and interest of the bonds. The City would use this money to build, buy, improve, and rehabilitate facilities and infrastructure and for affordable housing in Oakland. The projects financed by the bonds would be completed as needed according to City Council established priorities as set forth in the City’s Capital Improvement Plan.</p>
  

  <h3>Police Commission</h3>
  
    
    <p><a href="/odca-jekyll/referendum/oakland/2016-11-08-ll/">LL Police Commission</a></p>
    <p>This measure would establish a Police Commission consisting of seven regular and two alternate members. Commission members would be Oakland residents with no member permitted to be a police officer, current City employee, former Oakland police officer, or current or former official, employee or representative of a union that represents police officers. The first group of Commissioners would serve two, three, or four year terms. Later members would serve three-year terms with a two-term limit. The Commission would establish a Community Police Review Agency (“Agency”) which would receive and review complaints of police misconduct. The Agency would be required to investigate complaints involving use of force, in-custody deaths, profiling and public assemblies. After completing its investigation of a complaint, the Agency would submit its findings and proposed discipline to the Commission and Chief. In addition The Commission would review the OPD’s policies, procedures and General Orders while being able to propose changes and approve or reject the OPD’s changes to those policies. The majority of the Commission’s members would be independently appointed by a panel of Oakland residents with subpoena power and five commissioners could vote to fire the chief.</p>
  

  <h3>Oakland School Bond</h3>
  
    
    <p><a href="/odca-jekyll/referendum/oakland/2016-11-08-g1/">G1 Oakland School Bond</a></p>
    <p>This measure will provide a districtwide educator salary increase designed to attract/retain teachers; provide enhanced middle school art, music, languages/other programs in addition to core educational programs; improve academic achievement; provide safe, positive schools, and prepare students for college/careers; shall Oakland Unified School District levy a tax of $120 per parcel, providing $12.4 million annually, for 12 years, with exemptions for senior and low income residents, no money for Sacramento, and all money benefitting Oakland students?</p>
